# GNT Vocab Project
This is a project to help myself, and any others in a similar situation, maintain a high level of fundamental Greek vocabulary to effectively read the Greek New Testament. There is hope to extend this to the Hebrew Bible and to also include quite a bit of grammar and syntax resources. But, for now, I am developing this as a vocabulary resource only.

## Acknowledgements
Quite a bit of work has been done by @jtauber (GitHub Username) and others in this area. This project is built upon much of the resources they produced, as well as their source data, which has been made available for public use. This project is made openly available in the same spirit.
